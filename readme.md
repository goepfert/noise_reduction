# Noise Reduction Demo

Demonstrator project for noise reduction on speech audio data using machine learning. This project tries to use the same technique as described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07132.pdf). It's also nicely described in this [blog post](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-build-a-deep-audio-de-noiser-using-tensorflow-2-0-79c1c1aea299).

Short summary of the used techniques:
- (Cascaded Redundant) Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Network
- Tensorflow.js
- Web Audio API
- Based on vanilla javascript

Check some examples here in the [Demo](https://goepfert.github.io/noise_reduction/). Note: Example data was also used in the training phase.

Since I'm pretty happy with the result I'll stop this project by now.
