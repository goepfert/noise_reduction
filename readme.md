# Noise Reduction Demo

Demonstrator project for noise reduction on speech audio data using machine learning. This project tries to use the same technique as described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07132.pdf). It's also described in this [blog post](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-build-a-deep-audio-de-noiser-using-tensorflow-2-0-79c1c1aea299).

Check some results here in the [Demo Examples](https://goepfert.github.io/noise_reduction/)
